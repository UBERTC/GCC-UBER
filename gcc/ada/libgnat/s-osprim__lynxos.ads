--  This package provides low level primitives used to implement clock and
--  delays in non tasking applications, for LynxOS.

--  The choice of the real clock/delay implementation (depending on whether
--  tasking is involved or not) is done via soft links (see s-soflin.ads)

--  NEVER add any dependency to tasking packages here

package System.OS_Primitives is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   Max_Sensible_Delay : constant Duration := 16#10_0000.0#;
   --  LynxOS does not support delays as long as half a year, so we set this to
   --  a shorter, but still fairly long, duration. Experiments show that if
   --  pthread_cond_timedwait is passed an abstime much greater than about
   --  2**21, it fails, returning EAGAIN. The cutoff is somewhere between
   --  16#20_8000.0# and 16#20_F000.0#. This behavior is not documented.

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Initialize global settings related to this package. This procedure
   --  should be called before any other subprograms in this package. Note
   --  that this procedure can be called several times.

   function Clock return Duration;
   pragma Inline (Clock);
   --  Returns "absolute" time, represented as an offset relative to "the
   --  Epoch", which is Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC on UNIX systems. This
   --  implementation is affected by system's clock changes.

   Relative          : constant := 0;
   Absolute_Calendar : constant := 1;
   Absolute_RT       : constant := 2;
   --  Values for Mode call below. Note that the compiler (exp_ch9.adb) relies
   --  on these values. So any change here must be reflected in corresponding
   --  changes in the compiler.

   procedure Timed_Delay (Time : Duration; Mode : Integer);
   --  Implements the semantics of the delay statement when no tasking is used
   --  in the application.
   --
   --    Mode is one of the three values above
   --
   --    Time is a relative or absolute duration value, depending on Mode.
   --
   --  Note that currently Ada.Real_Time always uses the tasking run time,
   --  so this procedure should never be called with Mode set to Absolute_RT.
   --  This may change in future or bare board implementations.
